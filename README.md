# Story

## Why is it here?
This game project was unfortunately not finished because I had been working with many other different projects. This one
is a small side-project which I used to practice my programming and game development skills. It turned out that I could
not manage to complete this; therefore, I uploaded it here for you to develop and work on the game in your own way.

## What has been done in my development process?
The environment is complete; the whole game proceeds within a house. The algorithms are lacking.

## Getting Started
### This project is built with:

* [Unity3D](https://store.unity.com) - Game Engine
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) - 3D Modeling (small detailed model)
* [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/download) - 3D Modeling (big generic model)

### Installing the Project:
Download the project, open it, run the Scene file, and you can start to work on it immediately!

## Screenshots
To be added soon.
